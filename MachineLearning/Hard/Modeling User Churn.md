# Predicting Robinhood User Churn

## Step 1: Define Churn & Business Impact
- **Clarify churn**: Loss of users due to inactivity or account closure.
- **Why it matters**: High churn leads to increased acquisition costs.
- **Robinhood churn indicators**:
  - Canceling Robinhood Gold.
  - No trading activity for a long period.
  - Low or zero account balance over time.

## Step 2: Modeling Considerations
- **Binary classification** problem (Churn vs. Active).
- **Preferred models**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: Probability estimation, simple & explainable.
  - **Decision Trees/Random Forest**: Balance between accuracy & interpretability.
  - **Neural Networks/SVMs**: If pure detection is needed without explainability.
- **Understand business needs**: How will the model be used?

## Step 3: Key Features for Churn Prediction
- **Account Balance**: Low balance → higher churn risk.
- **Balance Trend**: Steady withdrawals → potential churn.
- **Trading Losses**: Recent large losses → loss of confidence.
- **Usage Patterns**: Declining logins/trades → disengagement.
- **User Demographics**: Age, location, trading behavior.

## Step 4: Deploy & Monitor Model
- **Evaluate model**: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, F1 score.
- **Monitor performance**: Regular updates & feedback from customer teams.
- **Error analysis**: Identify misclassified cases & refine features.
- **A/B testing**: Measure impact before full deployment.
