# **Approach to Predicting Class-A High-Rise Residential Property Value**

The dataset provided contains only a few thousand rows, indicating a **limited volume of data**. Additionally, the dataset includes **thousands of features**, increasing the risk of **overfitting**. Since our goal is to predict a **numeric value**, this is a **regression problem**.  

## **Step-by-Step Approach**

### **1. Feature Selection & Reduction**
- Remove irrelevant attributes such as **addresses, past buyer information, or other non-impactful data**.
- Consult a **real estate subject matter expert (SME)** to eliminate features that do not contribute to property valuation.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to detect **outliers, uncorrelated variables, and high-variance columns**.

### **2. Dimensionality Reduction**
- Apply **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the number of features while retaining the most important information.

### **3. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Handle **missing values** by either **removing or imputing** them appropriately.
- Scale and normalize numerical data to ensure **consistent feature weighting**.

### **4. Model Training & Optimization**
- Train multiple regression models, including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
  - **Lasso Regression**
  - **Ridge Regression**
- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** to optimize each model's performance.

### **5. Model Evaluation & Selection**
- Compare models using key metrics:
  - **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** â€“ to measure prediction accuracy.
  - **R-squared (RÂ²)** â€“ to assess how well the model explains variability.
- Select the best-performing model based on these metrics.

### **6. Deployment**
- Deploy the final model for real-world use, ensuring it is **continuously monitored and updated** with new data to maintain accuracy.

This structured approach balances **data quality, dimensionality reduction, model performance, and real-world applicability** to deliver an effective property valuation model. ðŸš€
