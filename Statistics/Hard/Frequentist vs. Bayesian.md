# Frequentist vs. Bayesian: A Quick Comparison  

## **Frequentist School of Thought**  
- Probability is the **long-run frequency** of an event occurring.  
- Parameters (e.g., population mean) are **fixed** but unknown.  
- We use **confidence intervals** and **p-values** to make inferences.  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If a coin is flipped 100 times and lands heads 55 times, a frequentist estimates the probability of heads as **55/100 = 0.55** and improves the estimate with more trials.  

## **Bayesian School of Thought**  
- Probability represents **degree of belief**, updated as new data arrives.  
- Parameters are **random variables** with prior distributions.  
- We use **Bayesâ€™ Theorem** to update beliefs based on new evidence.  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If we believe a coin is fair (**prior: 50% heads**), but after 10 flips we get 8 heads, a Bayesian updates the probability to **reflect the new data**.  

## **Which One to Use?**  
- **Frequentist:** Works well for large datasets, objective inference, and traditional statistical tests.  
- **Bayesian:** Better for **small datasets**, incorporating prior knowledge, and handling **uncertainty dynamically**.  


## **Key Difference**  
- **Z-score** tells us **how extreme** a value is in standard deviations.  
- **P-value** tells us **how surprising** that value is under the null hypothesis.  

**Rule of Thumb:**  
- Use **Z-score** when standardizing and comparing data.  
- Use **P-value** when making **hypothesis testing** decisions.
