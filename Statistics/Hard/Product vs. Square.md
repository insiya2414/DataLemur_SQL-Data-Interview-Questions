Game 1:
    Roll 2 dice at once
    Receive a dollar = product of rolls
    eg: Die1: 3 & Die2: 2
        product= 6--> $6
    E[X] * E[X] = E[X]^2
Game 2:
    Roll 1 die
    Receive a dollar = square of roll
    eg: Die: 4
    square = 16 --> $16
    E[X^2]

Higher Expected Value?

Variance = E[(X-E[X)]^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
Since the left-hand side is positive, as expected for the value of a squared number, then the right-hand side is also positive. Therefore, it must be the case that the second game has a higher expected value than the first.
