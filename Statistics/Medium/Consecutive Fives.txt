Event: A fair die is rolled

Sample Space: 6

(p)P(each roll) : 1/6

q = 1-1/6 =5/6 --> (p+q=1)

Consider the expected no. of the roll to get the 1st 5 is E1 and the 2nd 5 is E2

E = E1 + E2
So, the expected number of rolls until we get a 5 follows a geometric distribution with expectation:

E1= 1/p = 1/(1/6) = 6
Once we roll a 5, we now need another 5 immediately after. This process follows a waiting time problem:

With probability 1/6, we roll another 5 and are done (expectation = 1 roll). With probability 5/6, we roll something else and must restart the process (meaning we go back to waiting for the first 5 again, adding E more rolls to the expectation.

Therefore, E2 = 1+ 5/6(E)
Substituting E1 and E2 in E, we get:

E =6+ 1+5/6E

E =7+5/6E

7 =E-5/6E

7 =1/6E

E =7*6

E =42

The expected number of rolls until getting two consecutive 5s is 42.
