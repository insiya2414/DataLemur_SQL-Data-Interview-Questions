Null Hypothesis (Ho): The coin is fair, which means that the probability of heads is p= 0.5 

Alternative Hypothesis(Ha): The coin is biased, so p is not equal to 0.5

For a fair coin flipped ùëõ =1000 times, the number of heads follows a binomial distribution:
E[X] =n*p = 1000 x 0.5 = 500

Standard Deviation: 

sqrt(np(1-p)) = sqrt(1000 x 0.5 x 0.5) = sqrt(250) ~ 15.81

We calculate the Z-score to measure how far the observed result (550 heads) is from the expected 500: 

Z= (Observed - Expected)/ Standard Deviation
=(550-500)/ 15.81
~3.16

we are testing for bias in either direction (heads or tails), we consider the two-tailed p-value:

p=2√ó0.0008=0.0032

Since p=0.0032 is much smaller than 
0.05, we reject the null hypothesis

Since the probability of obtaining 550 heads (or more extreme results) in a fair coin flip is very low (0.32%), the evidence suggests that the coin is likely biased towards heads.
